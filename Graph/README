In the Graph project my work, in collaboration with a Czech collegue, was to create a graph composed by IDAuthor
as nodes and Publications as edges. 
At first we had to calculate several measures like "Degree Centrality", "Closeness Centrality" and "Betweeness Centrality".
After that, we created a subgraph induced by the nodes that had "Hop Distance" at most equal to an integer "d" which indicated
an IdAuthor.
Eventually, we implemented the Dijkstra algorithm by ourself.
Thanks to this, we've been able to check which was the distance between a node and all the others.
